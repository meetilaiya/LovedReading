You can go back to sleep after 9 if you want, but those 4 hours in the morning will change the way you live! Knowing that you have a headstart on the day, you will want to plan out your day, make time tables. Somehow waking up early, makes you feel good about yourself and you wouldn't want to give up on that, once you start off. :)</p><p class="qtext_para" style="margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, Times, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 15px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also , the first thing to do when you wake up is plan out briefly what you need to get done that day, and the last thing you do before going to bed is check an record what you actually did.

How much money did I spend today?</p><p class="qtext_para" style="margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, Times, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 15px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This does help a lot. I was once a heavy weight lazy 20 year old. Used to be good at academics while at school but somehow had lost all sorts of will power to study or keep myself healthy. But when I became morbidly obese, my parents started to worry and I started feeling lethargic. become Had lost all sense of self confidence too.</p><p class="qtext_para" style="margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, Times, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 15px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But a few months ago, I decided I need to stop this. So I got my shit together, and all I did was start waking up at 4am everyday. It was difficult. But I started out by reading novels in the morning. I have always been an avid reader and this habit made me want to wake up just to get more reading done. Slowly I started out exercising after reading and slowly started studying too. Having a psychologist as a mother helped quite a bit. :D</p><p class="qtext_para" style="margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, Times, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 15px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Started recording what I want to do and what I did each day.</p><p class="qtext_para" style="margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, Times, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 15px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past 3 months, my GPA shot up, I lost 20 kilos and became a better basketball player. Just by changing this habit of constantly staying on the internet and wasting time, I became a whole new person, a person who I am proud to talk about. :D</p><p class="qtext_para" style="margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, Times, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 15px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't get me wrong, I do need to catch up on my favorite shows and movies every weekend, but it doesn't seem like a waste of time anymore.</p><p class="qtext_para" style="margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, Times, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 15px;">Remember -&nbsp;<b><i>When you do the things that you need to do, when you need to do them, the day will come when you can do the things you want, when you want to do them.</i></b></p><p class="qtext_para" style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, Times, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 15px;">Hope this helps. :)</p><p class="qtext_para" style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, Times, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 15px;"><br></p><p class="qtext_para" style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Georgia, Times, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 15px;"><a href="https://www.quora.com/I-want-to-study-but-I-waste-my-whole-day-without-doing-anything-significant-I-really-want-to-study-but-I-am-unable-to-concentrate-What-should-I-do/answer/Nupur-Joshi-1?srid=uLaia" target="_blank">Link</a></p>
