The simplest way is to rebase the currency.
<ul>
<li>Introduce a new currency - New Indian Rupee - that is equal to 100 rupees. 1 NIR = 100 INR.</li>
<li>Ask RBI to print a lot of new currency and the RBI would in turn ask the banks to load up the ATMs with the new currency.</li>
<li>Declare the existing currency [INR] as invalid for transaction and for a limited period the banks will take in the existing rupee notes for the new Indian rupee. As an added bonus it will bring a lot of black money out.</li>
<li>Make the banks and all financial institutions convert existing debts to the new currency. Since everything is computerized it can happen with the push of a button. Thus, your 10 lakhs in INR savings will become 10000 NIR and your monthly EMI of 20000 INR will become 200 NIR. Same for your salaries etc.</li>
<li>Since 1 NIR = 100 INR, by simple mathematics, 1 NIR will approximately equal 1 GBP and about 1.5 USD.</li>
<li><li>After a couple of years, completely remove the existing INR from the system and rename the NIR to INR.</li>
<ul>
It changes nothing in the economy and will invite some derision from global economists, but can give satisfaction to some of the uber nationalists that their currency is “higher than” the mighty dollar.

People assume the absolute value of a currency is somehow correlated with the strength of an economy. If that were the case, Japan must be significantly poorer than India and Kuwait must be way richer than Switzerland. As I mentioned above, any country can rebase their currency without changing anything in the economy.

If currency value doesn’t matter, what matters? The only thing that matters to an economy in the long term is the productivity of the people - if an average Indian can produce more value of goods than an average non-Indian, the average Indian will be richer and Indian economy will be the richest. Thus, the only thing that matters is how we can get an average Indian to produce more and get better value.
